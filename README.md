#An Application for tracking monopoly give away prizes and game pieces
If you like playing the monopoly collect game pieces game, but do not like having to attach pieces to the game board, then you will like this application that I whipped up for myself over the weekend. Simply click on the prize add or subtract piece quantities and store the actually pieces away until you win. Currently it is somewhat hardcoded to the current game going on here in Seattle and abroad.(2/29/2007) But could easily be adapted or improved upon. *I created this for my own use and invite you to use it if you wish, but at your own risk.*  **Pull request welcome.**
###To use:
This expects a mongodb database called monopoly. After cloning, the easiest way to get started is to use the mongo tools command [mongoimport](https://docs.mongodb.org/v2.6/reference/program/mongoimport/) and the monoprize.json file provided **Highly Recommended**. This file has all the fields setup and some data which you can easily set with your own data using the application. There are a number of things required if you setup your own database so unless you really want to dive deep into the tightly coupled nature of this application, you will need to start with the mock data.
